We decided to use 1000 particles that each start at a random postion between (0,wdith) and (0,height) each with a random lifetime that was between 0 and 201. 
The paticle class also has an age variable that keeps track of how long the particle has been drawn and making sure it does not exceed the life cycle. 

Our step size is 0.1 since a smaller step size will give a good approximate path. If we increase the step size
for the integration, we see the particles move at a faster speed and jump/ move a long a 
path at a bigger distance making it a less accurate integration. T
